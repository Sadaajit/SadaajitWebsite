      <h2>About</h2>
      <br />

        <p >Hi, my name is Sadaajit (Saw-daw&rsquo;-jit) Ananda, which means &ldquo;blissfully ever victorious.&rdquo; For years I played around with web sites, mostly in Wordpress. I shied away from becoming a full-fledged developer, because I thought coding was really difficult. However, with encouragement from a friend, I decided to take a closer look at coding. I started out with HTML and CSS and was pleasantly surprised when I found it fun, and challenging. I wanted to learn more.</p>
        <br />

        <p>This started me down a whirlwind path of learning from every online source I could manage: codecademy.com; WatchandCode.com; FreeCodeCamp.com; lynda.com; pluralsight.com; teamtreehouse.com; a plethora of books; online videos; friends; and other coders. As I delved deeper and deeper into coding the more I found it captured my attention, required creativity, problem solving, and perseverance. All of which are some of my strengths and things I really enjoy.</p>
        <br />

        <p> Throughout my career I&rsquo;ve needed all the qualities of a front-end developer - creativity, problem solving, attention to detail, tenacity, careful listening, writing copy, editing/proofreading. I also have this seemingly supernormal ability to just look at a web page and see what I&rsquo;m looking for almost instantaneously. </p>
        <br />

        <p>Through the years I&rsquo;ve also developed skills in working in teams, communicating effectively, high performance under stress, and have always brought more to the position than was asked of me.</p>
        <br />

        <p>My love of music, the arts, gardening, and sewing helped me to develop design aesthetics, because I understand the need for balance, symmetry, cohesiveness, color coordination, and more.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Having worked in offices helped me to develop skills in organization, policies, and procedures. All of which transfer to the user interface of a web site, as well as clean organized and understandable code.</p>
      </br>
      <p>
        I've been looking for a career path that used most, if not all, of my skills and passions. It took a long time, but I've finally found it and look forward to coding into the forseeable future.
      </p>
